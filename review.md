Hello, this is Sirat Baweja, an intern at SmartBridge for their Remote Internship program this summer.
Thank you so much for giving me an internship as an Artificial Intelligence Developer! This video is a
review of the platform and the internship. 

First of all, the online student dashboard that SmartBridge provides at the start of the internship is really cool. It makes it super easy
to navigate through all the topics that are to be studied and implemented throughout the program, as there is a whole section provided just
for the **project details**. There are two other sections, the first being a **task and progress** area and the second, a **mentor review**
area. The first works as a kanban board and helps you keep a track of all your tasks and the progress you've made in them. It has four
sections that demonstrate four different levels of completion - _Backlog, In-Progress, Review, Complete._ The last section is the
mentor review section, which can be used to directly communicate with mentors. 

Then, there's three separate services provided in order to complete the project, the **[Git Repository](https://github.com/SmartPracticeschool/llSPS-INT-229-AI-Powered-News-Search-App-Level-1-)** to keep a track of your code, 
the **[Zoho Writer](https://workdrive.zohoexternal.com/writer/open/kg30z0d5ea1c93990472da05a4f579f4a3f12?authId=%7B%22linkId%22%3A%225k2wAp9FECl-LYmlU%22%7D)** to write down your code's documentation and the **[Slack Channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T012D037CBG)** to interact with 
all the mentors and other interns. 

Overall, this internship experience was amazing since I got to learn many new technologies I hadn't used before, that too in a 
professional work environment. Thank you to all the people at IBM and SmartBridge who made this happen!
